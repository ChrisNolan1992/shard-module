    <p class="lead">Configuring DoctineModule and DoctrineMongoODMModule</p>

    <p>DoctrineModule and DoctrineMongoODMModule are maintained by the Doctrine project for integrating Doctrine Mongo ODM with zf2. They provide their own configuration documentation. Use these modules to configure a DocumentManager and possibly other services, such as an AuthenticationAdapter. Shard Module will use the services configured by these modules.</p>
